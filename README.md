# nanoteer.Boards
Libraries of different gadgeteer mainboards migrated to the nanoframework

## Why  
This project aims to port the Gadgeteer project to the [nanoFramework](https://nanoframework.net/) environment

## How  
For now, I will develop the code using my board (GHI Fez Cerberus) and some modules I own

## What  
This repo will contains the code of differents boards from different manufacturers (GHI, ...)
